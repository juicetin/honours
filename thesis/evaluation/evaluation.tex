\chapter{Evaluation and Discussion} \label{chap:evaluation}

\todo{old note - these will likely be in results/described in experiments} Looking at distributions of the GPs, dirichlet multinomial draws and how they perform beyond just taking argmax, etc. should go here

\subsection{Limitations}

\begin{itemize}
    \item training data doesn't explore any particular area exhaustively - hard to verify how accurate any model is even if cross validation scores are high
\end{itemize}
