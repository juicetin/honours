\subsection{Limitations}

\begin{itemize}
    \item data simply not varied enough/uninteresting habitat spread in Scott Reef?
    \item training data doesn't explore any particular area exhaustively - hard to verify how accurate any model is even if cross validation scores are high
    \item from the full 24 clusters, it's apparent that some were clustered as a result of lighting, unfortunately not a desired behaviour ==> possible future work is to first 'normalize' the contrast/visual properties of the images beforehand \todo{(Get a citation for this, I think it was an ACFR paper)}
    \item as a result of non-normalised images and hence somewhat flawed classifications, label 0 fails to be predicted often across most models tested, exacerbated in the 24-label case
        \begin{itemize}
            \item suggests that data may be insufficient, or that certain data from images may need to be incorporated into training data
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
