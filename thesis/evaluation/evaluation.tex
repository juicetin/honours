\chapter{Evaluation and Discussion} \label{chap:evaluation}

\todo{old note - these will likely be in results/described in experiments} Looking at distributions of the GPs, dirichlet multinomial draws and how they perform beyond just taking argmax, etc. should go here

even in 4-label case, label 0 almost always fails to be identified, exacerbated in 24-label case\\
need to get per-label f-scores

\subsection{Limitations}

\begin{itemize}
    \item training data doesn't explore any particular area exhaustively - hard to verify how accurate any model is even if cross validation scores are high
    \item from the full 24 clusters, it's apparent that some were clustered as a result of lighting, unfortunately not a desired behaviour ==> possible future work is to first 'normalize' the contrast/visual properties of the images beforehand \todo{(Get a citation for this, I think it was an ACFR paper)}
\end{itemize}
