\chapter{Introduction}

Earth's oceans cover 70\% of its surface, but only less than 10\% of the Earth's oceans have been explored to date\footnote{Oceanservice.noaa.gov. (2016). How much of the ocean have we explored?. [online] Available at: http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/exploration.html}. There have been increasing efforts over the past few decades to map out these unexplored areas to monitor marine ecosystems to be able to track the state of them over time for management, preseveration, etc. purposes. The process used is called benthic habitat mapping, which is the predicting of what exists at the bottom of a body of water. Most recent studies looking to create benthic habitat maps share some basic key steps - acoustic data is used to estimate properties about the surface of the water, which are then mapped to, using machine learning algorithms, \textit{in situ} data such as still images, videos, or samples of the area in question. It is the relationship which is inferred between the different data sets inferred using machine learning techniques that varies between studies.
