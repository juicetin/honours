\chapter{Experiments and Results} \label{chap:experiments}

To show that using Dirichlet Multinomial Regression provides richer and more valuable information than single-output or deterministic methods alone, we ran experiments on the data obtained from the ACFR's Sirius AUV and Schmidt's Falkor. In this chapter, we first assess the performance and usefulness of information of single output labels, to first highlight the need for models that can effectively perform multi-output predictions.

As seen in the previous chapter, a key benefit to applying the Dirichlet Multionomial distribution to the data is that it able to naturally perform multi-output predictions on label distributions that correctly sum back to $1$. To illustrate this point, SVMs, Linear Regression, K-Nearest Neighbour, Random Forest, and Gaussian Process Regression were all coerced to perform multiple predictions across each label's normalised distribution values, where the results were compared with those of a Dirichlet Multinomial Regressor. However, an important point to keep in mind is that these models do not maintain the constraint of predictions per point summing back to $1$, but they have been included in the experiments to illustrate if they can still provide reasonable results despite being an inherently `incorrect' model, with the advantage of having implementations more readily available in open source libraries, and being more exhaustively studied in literature in general.

We also explored how to use the data to extract information about biodiversity and the corresponding confidence, indicated by the predictive variance in the case of Gaussian Processes and Dirichlet Multinomials. Moreover, to contrast the Dirichlet Multinomial's ability to naturally provide information about co-existing habitats with certainty, we compared the regions in which the Dirichlet Multinomial was certain with those in Gaussian Process predictions, looking at both the overlapping areas and the corresponding level of variance observed in both models.

\section{Training Data}
To perform our experiments, bathymetry data and images of Scott Reef Central were used (the reef in the centre of \autoref{fig:scottreefaerial}). The bathymetry data was collected using Eric Schmidt's Falkor at the locations in \autoref{fig:gridsplit}, a ship dedicated to marine research, and the (over 700GB) of images corresponding to all the bathymetry data was collected by The University of Sydney's Australian Centre for Field Robotic's Sirius Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV). The training set provided already had labels assigned, which was a result of previous efforts using Variational Dirichlet Processes that performed the unsupervised clustering \citep{steinberg11}. \todo{(currently not relevant/no context for next sentence)} On close inspection, the UTM coordinates in the training set do not correspond to the original data available from \cite{squidle} - this was because the exact point of retrieval for the bathymetry and image weren't exact matches. To account for this, labels corresponding to bathymetry points were in fact taken from the closest images, rather than exact longitude/latitude or UTM matches, although the UTM coordinates in the training data itself remains as the original. \todo{(describe the specific features - depth, aspect, rugosity, etc.)}
