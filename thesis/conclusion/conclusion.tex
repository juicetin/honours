The conclusion goes here.

\section{Future Work}

\begin{itemize}
    \item perform similar experiments on incrementally changing data every few years - observe biodiversity/habitat changes
    \item replace the simple activation function in the dirichlet multinomial with a more complex model like a GP
    \item previous work has been done for finding least certain areas of a GP to decide where to send AUV's to maximise resulting confidence in habitat labels - use entropy to be able to do the same with dirichlet multinomials, whilst overcoming the problem of areas with consistent heterogenous labels that otherwise confuse GPs
\end{itemize}
