# Motivation/Objective of own work 
* 1 minute
* Benthic habitat mapping studies generally use deterministic, single-output methods
* For people involved in manging or conserving ocean habitats, they need to be able to quantatively assign risk to any action they may need to take
    + this allows appropriate resources dedicated to backup actions/fallbacks that may need to be put into place
    + an all-or nothing approach is not an option in terms of any sort of environmental conversation
* probabilistic methods (GPs) have a time constraint
* need for multi-output
* because of the way data 
# Background literature 
* 1 minute
* go through some basic deterministic approaches used in the past - SVMs, RFs, even LR
* mention works that have touched on use of GPs - Bender's 2012 work
# Outlining of own approach/method/algorithm 
* 3 minutes
* applying GP approximations to mapping to see how they perform relative to deterministic methods
* multi-output by not simplifying the data
